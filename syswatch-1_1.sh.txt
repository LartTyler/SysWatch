INTERFACE="eth0"

# MEM_THRESHOLD:
#       This is the memory threshold, in percent of total system RAM. Once the current usage exceeds the
#       threshold, the program will start to spit out debug information to be emailed.
#       NOTE: MUST have a single decimal place at the end.
MEM_THRESHOLD=75.0

# DRP_RX_THRESHOLD:
#       This is the maximum number of packets received that WE dropped allowed on the interface before we start to notify. Once
#       this number of drops is passed, we start emailing data.
DRP_RX_THRESHOLD=10

# DRP_TX_THRESHOLD:
#       This is the maximum number of packets transmitted that WE dropped allowed on the interface before we start to notify. Once
#       this number of drops is passed, we start emailing data.

#       What email address to send the update to. If left blank, this script will log to ~/.syswatch.

# LOG_SIZE_LIMIT:
#       The maximum size (in megabytes) the log file can reach before it needs to be rolled. The old log file will be moved to

#       SUBJECT is the default subject line for any error mails. Normall, a subject line on an error mail would look something like
#       "Memory error - TX error". By adding a string to SUBJECT here, you can add a prefix before the error reporting, for example,
#       if you set SUBJECT to "Hurricane Log", your new error subject would look like "Hurricane Log - Memory error - TX error"
